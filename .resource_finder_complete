Key Finding from Literature Review:
LLMs have partial but incomplete differentiation between epistemic and non-epistemic belief.
Internally, they maintain representations encoding aspects relevant to epistemic distinctions.
Behaviorally, they fail to consistently deploy these distinctions, confusing knowledge with
belief, allowing non-epistemic contextual features to override epistemic commitments, and
failing at formal epistemic reasoning.
